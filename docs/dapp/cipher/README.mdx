# Cipher ParaTime

Cipher is a confidential ParaTime for executing Wasm smart contracts.

As the officially supported ParaTime by the Oasis Protocol Foundation, Cipher
allows for:

* Flexibility: developer can define which data to store in a public
  and which data in the (more expensive) confidential storage
* Security: the [rust language] primarily used for writing Wasm smart contracts
  is known for its strict memory management and was developed specifically to
  avoid memory leaks
* Scalability: increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost: 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* 6 second finality (1 block)
* Cross-chain bridge to enable cross-chain interoperability (upcoming)

If you're looking for EVM-compatible ParaTimes, check out the
[Emerald](../emerald/README.mdx) and the confidential
[Sapphire](../sapphire/README.mdx) paratimes.

## Smart Contract Development

Cipher implements the [Oasis Contract SDK] API. To learn how to write a
confidential smart contract in Rust and deploy it on Cipher, read the related
Oasis Contract SDK chapters:

## RPC Endpoints

:::danger

The RPC endpoint is a *point of trust*. Beside traffic rate limiting, it can
also perform censorship or even a man-in-the-middle attack. If you have security
considerations, we strongly recommend that you set up your own [ParaTime client
node][paratime-client-node].

:::

Cipher endpoints share the gRPC protocol with the Oasis Core. You can connect to
one of the public endpoints below (in alphabetic order):

[paratime-client-node]: ../../node/run-your-node/paratime-client-node.mdx

| Provider                    | Mainnet RPC URLs    | Testnet RPC URLs            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Oasis Protocol Foundation] | `grpc.oasis.io:443` | `testnet.grpc.oasis.io:443` |

## Block Explorers

No block explorers are available for Cipher yet. Consider debugging the Cipher
blocks using the [`oasis paratime show`] command in [Oasis CLI].

[`oasis paratime show`]: ../../general/manage-tokens/cli/paratime.md#show
[Oasis CLI]: ../../general/manage-tokens/cli/README.md

:::tip

If you are running your own Cipher endpoint and you wish to be added to the
public list above, open an issue at [github.com/oasisprotocol/docs].
